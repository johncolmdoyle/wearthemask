## Description

A user can be authenticated or anonymous. 

Only an authenticated user can report an incident. Base information required will include:

* latitude/longitude of the incident
* date/time of the incident
* what was the actual incident - not wearing a mask? 
* how many people were involved in the incident

An anonymous user can view reported issues, either on a map as flags, or as a table.

Both an authenticated user and an anonymous user can verify if an incident is still going on.
